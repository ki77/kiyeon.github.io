        <p>Even as a busy student or office worker, regular exercise is critical. Our bodies are machines that will break down if not prepared.
        <p>The health department <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/howmuchexercisedoineed.html" target="_blank">recommends</a> getting around 30-60 minutes of exercise per day, which can be divided in chunks and spread out over the week.
           While this is a good goal, it's better to get at least a bit of exercise than no exercise.
           It's helpful to commit to exercising at a consistent time (like every morning at 7:00-7:30AM, before things get busy).
        <p>I like to do an evenly-spaced combination of strength (weight-lifting), cardio (running), flexibility (yoga), and fun sports (basketball, tennis). Here's my weekly exercise schedule:
        <table border="1">
          <thead>
            <th>Mon</th>
            <th>Tues</th>
            <th>Wed</th>
            <th>Thurs</th>
            <th>Fri</th>
            <th>Sat</th>
            <th>Sun</th>
          </thead>
          <tr>
            <td>weights</td>
            <td>run</td>
            <td>weights</td>
            <td>run</td>
            <td>weights</td>
            <td>sports</td>
            <td>run, yoga</td>
          </tr>
        <table>
        <p>StrongLifts.com has a great in-depth guide to weight-lifting. Read the <a href="https://www.stronglifts.com/about/" target="_blank">About</a> page story to get motivated and start the <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/" target="_blank">StrongLifts 5x5</a> workout.</p>
        <p>The NYT has a nice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/how-to-start-running" target="_blank">guide</a> on how to start running. The key point is to run around 30 minutes three days a week.
